# Werk
Werk is a C++ library of components for developing performance-sensitive,
real-time applications. Each Werk component is available a-la-carte (albeit
possibly with some dependencies, such as logging or configuration). A
lightweight framework that combines the most common components is also
[available](#framework).

To facilitate development and testing, a simulator is provided which can
replay historical data from a variety of formats (CSV, PCAP, etc.) as though it
were happening live.

# Getting Started

## Build
Werk uses [Waf](https://waf.io/) to build and automate other development
workflows like unit tests. To make things simple, a copy of Waf is included in
the distribution and may be run with `./waf`, which by default will execute an
incremental build of the project.

If you try running that in a freshly cloned repository, you'll be told you need
to configure: `./waf configure`. This sets settings such as debug/release. Run
`./waf configure -d` to configure a debug build.

To see help and additional options, run `./waf -h`.

## Testing
Unit tests may be run after building by running `./waf test`. Because `waf` can
accept more than one action, you can build and test in one command:
`./waf build test`.

## Profiling
Profiling code is included for critical components to help identify performance
regressions. Run `./waf profile` to profile.

## Valgrind
To help identify memory errors, Valgrind is built into the build system.
To run tests or profiling with `valgrind`, add the `--valgrind` option:
`./waf test --valgrind` or `./waf profile --valgrind`. When running outside of
valgrind, profiling also acts as a test that may fail if times are too high,
automatically identifying performance regressions.

## Hello World
The Hello World of Werk applications is included as an example of how to
instantiate the [framework](#framework). To run it (and format the JSON logs for
human consumption), run:

    > build/bin/HelloWorld | scripts/FormatLog.py
    [00000] [1491267909.296769000]   CONFIG - <Config> [Application.ConfigPaths] = (null) [DEFAULT]
    [00002] [1491267909.296769000]  SUCCESS - <Config> Initialized.
    [00003] [1491267909.296769000]   CONFIG - <Config> [Application.LogPath] = (null) [DEFAULT]
    [00000] [1491267909.296769000]  SUCCESS - <Log> Initialized.
    ...

## Continuous Integration (CI)
Gitlab CI support is included via the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root of the
repository. If available, it will build, unit test, profile, and functional test
(via the Hello World app) both debug and release after every push. All testing
and profiling code is run twice: once without valgrind and once with valgrind.

# Design
Although Werk is not a framework and does not enforce a particular threading
model, it does have several high level design rules in order to meet its
performance requirements:
* I/O and most other system calls should be deferred from any critical path
thread into a background thread, and done asynchronously. Components that
require I/O should be designed to support this, while still allowing synchronous
execution when possible.
* In the same vein, `new` generally should not be called after initialization.
This has advantages besides avoiding a possible `sbrk()` call; for example, it
guarantees that the application will not fail after startup by running out of
memory.

# Components
Components below are presented in roughly the order that they depend upon each
other. For a standard set of basic components, look at the `ApplicationContext`
class.

### Math
To enable analytics (e.g. for profiling), a variety of signal processing and
statistical components are included:
* `ContinuousEma`: Calculate an EMA with a continuous value.
* `DiscreteDistribution`: Calculates statistics about a weighted set of ordered
values, including probability information.
* `DiscreteEma`: Calculate an EMA with discrete steps.
* `OrderStatistics`: Calculate fractiles and other order statistics on a set of
samples.
* `SimpleLinearRegression`: Calculate a simple linear regression from two sets
of samples.
* `SummaryStatistics` and `RangedSummaryStatistics`: Calculate basic summary
statistics (count, average, std-dev, and optionally min/max).
* `WeightedSummaryStatistics`: Calculate summary statistics on a weighted set
of samples.

### Profiling
In order to maintain performant code and identify outliers which require
remediation, a light-weight profiling implementation is provided.

`Profile`s keep track of the start and end times of a given sample, and then
insert the delta into an `OrderStatistics` instance. Once that instance has a
certain number of samples (default=100), the `OrderStatistics` is sampled at
various fractiles into a set `SummaryStatistics` instances, then cleared. This
allows for an O(1) implementation while still collecting information about the
50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentile times.

`Profile`s are named and held by a `ProfileManager` class which allows exporting
the summary statistics to JSON for upstream analysis.

### Background Thread
To keep latency low on the main application thread(s), a `BackgroundThread`
class offers a place to defer I/O from other components. A set of `Action`s is
run at a configurable interval. Although actions do not have a latency budget,
they must return as all multitasking is cooperative. To ensure performance,
background actions are automatically profiled by providing a `ProfileManager`
to the `BackgroundThread` upon instantiation.

Built-in actions include:
* `ActionQueue`: Queues other `Action`s to be run a single time -- useful for
queueing actions to be run on another thread.
* `ConditionalAction`: Executes another `Action` only if a `Latch` is set.
* `CounterAction`: Counts the number of times the action is executed.
* `IncrementCounterAction`: Increments a `Counter` (appropriate when a more
complex counter is needed than the simple one in `CounterAction`).
* `NullAction`: Does nothing (useful as a placeholder or for testing).
* `ResetAction`: Resets any component that has a `void reset()` method (`Latch`,
`Counter`, `Watchdog`, etc.).
* `SetLatchAction`: Sets a flag.
* `Watchdog`: Watches a flag and executes another `Action` if it does not get
before a predefined interval expires. This allows for deadlock detection and
many other behaviors to be run on the background thread.

### Logging
Logs are written in a machine-readable [JSON lines](http://jsonlines.org/)
format. They can either be written synchronously with `SyncLog` or
asynchronously with `AsyncLog` on a `BackgroundThread`.

### Configuration
A reloadable configuration system which can read from multiple `ConfigSource`s
(allowing integration with standard formats as well as custom and proprietary
ones) and propagate updates to a set of `Configurable` objects. As `Config`s are
read, the values are logged, making everything auditable.

### Commands
To allow for easy configuration of actions, and also user input, string command
lines can be accepted and parsed by a `CommandManager`, which will forward
execution to the appropriate `Command` instance. Command managers optionally
start with a set of default, standard commands.

Built-in commands include:
* `echo`, `warning`, `error` (`EchoCommand`): Logs the arguments at a certain
log level.
* `null` (`NullCommand`): Does nothing (useful as a placeholder for testing).
* `?`, `help`: Logs information about commands.
* `version`: Logs the version of Werk the application is running.
* `redo`: Runs the last command again.

A `CommandAction` helper class allows a `Command` to be run whenever an `Action`
is needed, opening up many opportunities for connecting components.

### Console
Consoles allow users to connect to a real time run and enter commands. Currently
the only available console is the `IpcConsoleServer` and `IpcConsoleClient` pair
which send commands over an IPC queue. The client application is built as
`bin/build/IpcConsoleClient`.

# Framework
Althought Werk does not force the use of any particular threading model or set
of components, it does offer a default combination of the most common components
via the `ApplicationContext` class. Bootstrapping from a background thread and a
logger that goes to `stdout`, it loads configs, creates a file log, sets up
subsystems like commands and profiling, then runs some startup commands. An
optional main loop may then be run.

## Startup
On startup, default signal handlers are register for segfaults and bus errors,
the background thread is started, then logging and configuration ar
bootstrapped:
* `Application.ConfigPaths`: Only available in the primary config, this is a
comma-separated list of other configs to load. Default none.
* `Application.LogPath`: Path to the actual log file. If not present or cannot
be opened, logs will go to stderr. Required.

Then the following configuration options are read and their respective
components initialized:
* `Application.InstanceID`: ID of this instance of the application, for audit
trail purposes.
* `Application.ProfilesPath`: Path to profiling information JSON, written on
shutdown. Default none.
* `Application.BackgroundThreadInterval`:  The interval of the background
thread, in nanoseconds. Default 10ms.
* `Application.Debug`: Boolean indicating whether the application is in debug
mode (causing it to output additional information). Default false.
* `Application.Simulation`: Boolean indicating whether the application is a
simulation. Default false.
* `Application.RealTime`: Boolean indicating whether the application is running
in real time. Default true.
* `Application.IpcConsoleName`: The name of the IPC queue used for a console.
Default none.

Finally, the background task `Scheduler` is started and startup commands are
run:
* `Application.StartupCommands`: Semicolon delimited list of command lines to
run on startup.

## Run Time
If the optional main loop is used by calling `ApplicationContext::run()`, first
some configurations are read:
* `Application.WatchdogInterval`: The interval of the foreground thread watchdog.
* `Application.WatchdogAllowedMisses`: The number of times the foreground thread
can miss resetting the application watchdog.

Then a main loop is started which updates the curren time, runs a main `Action`,
then executes any defered `Action`s in the foreground queue and resets the
watchdog.

### Historical Data Replay
Runs without the real time flag set use a `TimeSeriesReplayer` to replay 1 or
more data sources (CSV's, PCAP's, etc.) as events. This allows for simple
testing against multiple sources of historical data.
* `Application.HistoricalDataSources`: Comma-separated list of paths to
historical data sources.
* `Application.HistoricalDataTimeout`: The maximum time between events (e.g.
`1s` or `10us`) -- if there is a larger gap, additional events are generated at
this interval.

### Commands
The application context adds additional default commands:
* `app`: Logs information about the high level state of the application.
* `bg`: Logs information about background tasks.
* `logs`: Logs information about what logs are available.
* `reload`: Reloads the configuration.
* `quit`: Quits the application cleanly, running shutdown commands and actions.

## Shutdown
The application may be shut down cleanly at any time by running the `quit`
command. Sending it a `SIGINT` (e.g. by pressing Ctrl+C) will also cause a
clean shutdown.

On shutdown:
* Shutdown commands are run (read from `Application.ShutdownCommands`)
* Shutdown actions, which may be registered by any component, are run
* The application exit with exit code 0.
